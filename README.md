# Description:
A mod of the Watercolor theme by roberTO, which is in turn based on the Windows "Whistler" theme. I have modified it so that you can use it with buttons on the left hand side.

Three variants: A version with rounded corners, one with a red close button, and one with a red close button that has been modified to work with buttons on the right side.

Also included: namebar theme. Instructions: Copy .tar.gz file to ~/.namebar/themes/, select Watercolor in namebar properties, restart namebar (or killall gnome-panel).
